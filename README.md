## Play with Gemini-demo with fine-tuned models:

**Binary classification**
 -  SELFIES: "tunedModels/selfies2class-g940h04i1llj"
 -  SMILES: "tunedModels/smiles2class-8vfa55zxzcq0"
 -  SMILES-learning-curves
   
    - 0.2: "tunedModels/lc202class-snm20iaybbky"
    - 0.4: "tunedModels/lc402class-qgvu93chlogj"
    - 0.6: "tunedModels/lc602class-ougqapi11atd"
    - 0.8: "tunedModels/lc802class-qg25gxdx2301"

**Quaternary classification**
 -  SELFIES: "tunedModels/selfies4class-572d54eewzgo"
 -  SMILES: "tunedModels/smiles4class-rpcpp9wje8vi"
 -  SMILES-learning-curves:
   
    - 0.2: "tunedModels/lc204class-oh1qkmpko1lu"
    - 0.4: "tunedModels/lc404class-f3drp4y2muzl"
    - 0.6: "tunedModels/lc604class-bhc63z2jtnay"
    - 0.8: "tunedModels/lc804class-cw4htxs9w4dx"
